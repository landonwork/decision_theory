    "Imagine you have an electrical contractor who has to decide how to wire new houses. They have options of 15, 20, and 30-amp wire. The higher the capacity of the wire, the more expensive it is for them. However, should the family moving into the new house ever exceed the rating of the wire, it will cause burnouts and they will have to eat the cost of rewiring the house. It will also damage their relationship with their business partners to have families constantly complaining about their work."
