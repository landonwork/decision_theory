The events where Alex is or is not infected by COVID-19 will be denoted as $COVID+$ and $COVID-$, respectively. The events where Alex tests positive or negative for COVID will be denoted as $TEST+$ and $TEST-$, respectively. Specificity and sensitivity represent the true negative rate and true positive rate, respectively. This means specificity = $P(TEST-|COVID-)$ and sensitivity = $P(TEST+|COVID+)$. In other words, specificity is the chance of receiving a negative result if the true state of nature is negative, and sensitivity is the chance of receiving a positive result if the true state of nature is positive."

Upon hearing this from their friend, Alex will automatically begin forming a prior belief about how likely it was they contracted COVID from their friend. This will depend on their proximity to each other the day before, the length of exposure, immunizations, and trust in their immune system and information about COVID-19. For simplicity, let's say that after considering these factors, Alex believes he has about 50/50 chance of having contracted COVID and decides that is enough to get tested."

    "Using this example, any individual might be able to decide whether it is safe to visit relatives or whether they should social distance or even quarantine. However, for a business owner with employees, it would enable them to decide whether it is too risky to allow a sick employee come in to work. In addition, the business owner should keep in mind the effectiveness of a test, namely the specificity and sensitivity and also consider selecting tests that favor one over the other. In this example, for instance, the tests have a higher specificity so that Alex's chances of receiving a false positive on the test are close to 0 (0.015), but some employers might prefer more sensitive tests (and less specific) so that false positives are more common. The costs of false positives versus false negatives (and even probabilities of each event) will depend on the individual's utility function and sometimes decision makers have control over which attributes they get to see in a test or experiment. We will discuss this in the next section."
