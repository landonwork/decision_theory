    "This chapter of the course will present a practical example (math and code included) and introduce the elements of decision theory. These four/five (TODO) elements are all necessary to practice decision theory. Most should be familiar with situations where the correct choice is not known or obvious. The rational decision-maker has a number of actions they can take in a situation, and depending on what is really going on (the state of nature), the decision-maker experiences a certain amount of gain or loss. Then they may perform experiments to further inform their decisions and devise a strategy that is optimal for them."

The higher the capacity of the wire, the more expensive it is for them. However, should the family moving into the new house ever exceed the rating of the wire, it will cause burnouts and they will have to eat the cost of rewiring the house. It will also damage their relationship with their business partners to have families constantly complaining about their work."

To find the average loss, we find the loss of these two actions for the 20-amp state of nature from Table 1 (5 and 2).
